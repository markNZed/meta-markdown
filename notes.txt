Can improve the OpenAI API e.g. cache 
  https://deno.com/blog/openai_sdk_deno
cloc --exclude-dir=node_modules,.git .
Integrate Jupyter AI - but it does not work with Deno
Dockerfile should set deno user ? Also need to modify devcontainer
Deno caches imports so can require restarting the notebook to refresh the cache
Integrate something like langchain into Javascript rather than Jupyter AI
https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/build-llm-apps-with-langchain-js/
Examples with deno + Jupyter https://github.com/rgbkrk/denotebooks
We don't need widgets but it is perhaps possible with
