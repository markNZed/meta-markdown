Notebook that identifes the most important critique and proposes solutions.
  The user can review inline and accept/reject

Tests are probably much easier to produce in JS rather than TS
deps.ts could allow for easy mocking with sinon
  Could use a custom import_map.json and pass with --import-map

deno test --allow-all --filter "getFilePaths" tests/utils/file.test.ts
deno run --allow-read src/scripts/tokenCount.ts markdown_private

Critical Review Loop Set up an automated "critique mode" that takes the current draft of a Markdown file and runs it through all these AI-powered edits sequentially. This would generate a detailed "critique report" that highlights developmental, line-level, and grammatical issues along with style suggestions, offering critical feedback without needing another human to review it.

Peer Review Simulation: AI can simulate a constructive peer review by using multiple perspectives, much like having colleagues provide feedback.

Automated Summarization and Review Reports: Using the summarization capabilities in summarizeAll.ts and getSummaryPrompt.ts, the writer can automatically generate a review summary of the entire documentation.

Meta Operation: Enable a "document structuring assistant" that helps the writer modularize their documentation, providing suggestions on breaking down long sections and organizing content more effectively.

Duplicate Text Detection and Monitoring
Define what good documentation is
  System prompt
Sanity tests
End-to-end tests

UI options:
  CLI https://github.com/c4spar/deno-cliffy
  GUI https://github.com/webview/webview_deno

TTS
  Concurrency for TTS requests to improve performance (for the podcast generation)
  Disk space checks to handle potential file system issues.
  Enhance text splitting for better coherence in more complex text structures.

Jupyter AI - does not work with Deno
Deno caches imports so requires restarting the kernel in notebook to refresh
  Even then it seems it can cache some files sometimes ?

Examples with deno + Jupyter https://github.com/rgbkrk/denotebooks

Uses Cases
----------
  Maintain FAQ
  Editorial review
    Prioritizing feedback
    Recommended edits
  Complete document rewrite based on target audience
    Role based presentation
  Automated Glossary and Indexing
  Model of the project/author
    Clarifying questions

Useful
------
cloc --exclude-dir=node_modules,.git .
We don't need widgets but it is perhaps possible with 
  https://github.com/rgbkrk/denotebooks/blob/main/anywidget.ipynb
jupyter notebook list
jupyter kernelspec list
With VS Code we can zoom in/out (Ctrl- Ctrl+) to fit external monitor scaling on Wayland.
To run deno tasks e.g.
  deno task watch-scripts
F5 runs the debugger again on the file

Lessons
-------
The notebook provides formatted output (with some limits when in VS Code)
Writing scripts may be preferrable for many tasks - with the terminal visible we have basic UI
Finding libraries with deno is painful and even more so with dependencies
  We can use NPM "npm:unified" then `deno run --lock=lock.json --lock-write your_script.ts` to create a lock.json file where exact versions can be found (and I guess reused)
