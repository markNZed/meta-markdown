The provided Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation indicates that the Markdown file is empty. Here is a formal description of the Markdown style based on this AST:

### Markdown Style Description

1. **File Structure**: 
   - The Markdown document does not contain any content, as indicated by the absence of any child nodes in the AST. 

2. **Content**:
   - There are no headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, or any other Markdown elements present in the document. 

3. **Position Information**:
   - The position information indicates that the parsing starts and ends at line 1, column 1, with an offset of 0. This further confirms that there are no characters or content in the Markdown file.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Markdown style used in this case can be described as a **blank or empty Markdown document**, which does not utilize any Markdown syntax or formatting features. Therefore, it lacks any visual representation or structured content typically associated with Markdown files.

In summary, the Markdown style represented by this AST is essentially non-existent due to the lack of any textual content.
